## What is Code0, you might ask?
Code0 is a no-code backend creator, designed to empower users to develop backends without the need for programming skills.

Our objective is to revolutionize conventional backend development. Traditional backend projects often entail lengthy processes, from deployment to programming and planning. Our objective is to simplify this process by introducing an application that provides users with the ability to create whatever they need.

Whether it's a backend for a personal project or a robust event-flow backend supporting applications with millions of users, Code0 makes it all possible. From RESTful APIs to event flows. Both seasoned developers and newcomers can effortlessly create and deploy the foundation for their upcoming product..

Creating a backend is now a breeze. Through our web application, you can effortlessly design the structure of a database or an event flow. With intuitive components, you can define flows, structures, and all the necessary components for your backend.

With ambitions as grand as ours, we've established fundamental principles for Code0: transparency, security, and innovation. These values underpin our commitment to openness, ensuring that our journey is shared with the community. We recognize that a robust and dependable product is born from iterative development, rigorous testing, and, most importantly, user feedback.
