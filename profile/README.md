## What is Code0, you might ask?

Code0 is a no-code backend creator, revolutionizing conventional backend development by empowering users to build
backends without programming skills.

With our platform, users can streamline the backend development process, eliminating the need for lengthy deployment,
programming, and planning. Through a node-based editor, you can create robust event flows, RESTful APIs, or event-based
systems effortlessly.

Imagine this scenario: you're envisioning the backend for your next social media app. You start by defining the database
structure via a model, then seamlessly implement the logic by creating a flow — all without writing a single line of code.
Validation and routing are configurable within the node.

Once you've completed the logic and database declaration, let's discuss testing and deployment. Testing your flows
seamlessly integrates into our editor, while deployment options include hosting on our cloud server or self-hosting.

Whether you're building a backend for a personal project or a high-traffic application, Code0 makes it all possible.
From RESTful APIs to event flows, our platform caters to both seasoned developers and newcomers, enabling effortless
creation and deployment of backend foundations.

## How do we build Code0?

With ambitious goals at the core of our mission, Code0 operates on fundamental principles: innovations, reliability,
transparency and security. These values are the bedrock of our commitment to openness, ensuring that our journey is
shared with the community. We understand that a reliable product stems from iterative development, rigorous testing, and
user feedback. That's why we've adopted an open-source approach, inviting contributions from all—including you—to
collectively shape the future of Code0.
